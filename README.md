This is just a project to calculate the different probabilities and occurences of different poker hands

This is based on Texas Hold 'Em. (Each player gets two cards, best hand wins)

Assumptions: 
 - No Folding (Feature to be implemented)
 - The Flop, River, and Turn are dealt after each player receives their cards
